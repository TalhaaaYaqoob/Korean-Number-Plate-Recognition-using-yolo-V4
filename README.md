# Korean-Number-Plate-Recognition-using-yolo-V4

A comprehensive list of custom functions for YOLOv4, YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv3, and YOLOv3-less used in TensorFlow, TFLite and TensorRT.

EXERCISE: This repository is very similar to my repository: tensorflow-yolov4-tflite. I created this repository to test custom coding functions that will be used with YOLOv4, and may make the application very difficult and slow down in terms of time complexity. So if you want to use the best YOLOv4 code with TensorFlow than move on to my other final site. This is a test of cool customization and apps that can be created using YOLOv4!

This model is trained on Korean Number plates.
